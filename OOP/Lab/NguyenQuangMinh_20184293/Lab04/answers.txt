10. Unique Item in the list
	1. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
		- So, the result of equals() is FALSE
		*In equals method, should check the class of obj by `instanceof` keyword*

11. Polymorphism
	1. Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe what happens and explain in detail.
		- Observe: The result of toString() if each subclass is printed
		- Explain: so cd, dvd, book are declared are all Media. When toString method of a media is called, it call the toString method of actual object which maybe cd, dvd, book.

12. Sort Media in the cart
	1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
		> Media class
	2. How should I implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering you want?
		> You want the list of media to be sorted in 2 way: (1) decreasing cost then title; (2) title then cost
		> So I have to implement 2 functions in 1 method, then I will make a flag inside the compareTo().
		So that the method could give different result due to each FLAG value. Flag values can be: "COST", "TITLE".
	3. Can I have 2 ordering rules of the item if I usr Comparable interface approach?
		> As I mentioned in the question 12.2: YES, but it does not mean we should.

	4. If DVD has a different ordering rule, how would I modify my code to allow this?
		> I will let DVD implement Comparable interface, apply that ordering rule for only DVD.


* NOTE: for project code *
In showMenu, at 'Update store', in 'add media' function: for simplicity, each type Media will be inputed with some of its attribute, example: just title, category and cost
